1. 
-The program is object oriented.
-The program is modular (separated in different files)
-The author separated the model (mainly in the class model.py) from the flaw of the game (mainly in the file game.py)


2. 
Examples of meaningful name in file game.py:
-dwarf_blocking_the_way (line 168): tell if there is a dwarf blocking the way
-move_dwarves(self) (line 188): move a dwarf from one location to another one 
-knife_wounds (line 210): count the number of knife wounds the player received

Examples of not meaningful names in file game.py
-foobar (line 27)
-h (line 259)


3. 
Same of the function in the program do just one thing, others appear to perform a list of different things.

Examples of function that make just one thing:
-write(self, more) (line 63 of game.py)
-is_dark(self) (line 81 of game.py)
-do_command(self, words) (line 427 of game.py) 
-die_here(self) (line 767 of game.py)

Examples of function that do more than one thing:
-move_dwarves(self) (line 188 of game.py)


4. 
At line 323 of the file game.py, the method describe_location(self).  From the name it appear to be a method that just describe the location. But in some cases it does other thing, like calling the method:
self.die_here() (Line 329)
self.do_motion(self.vocabulary[2])   (Line 346)


5.  


6. The program doesn’t use a lot of exception handling. It uses just in a few lines as at line 43 of adventure.py.
An input that causes an error is: ctr+c. The result is:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "adventure.py", line 44, in <module>
    loop()
  File "adventure.py", line 37, in loop
    line = raw_input('> ')
KeyboardInterrupt


7. 
The class Game (in the file game.py), for example, has responsibility over many piece of functionality and could be broken in smaller, more cohesive classes.   


8. 
The following classes are not cohesive:
-Game (in the file game.py) has many attributes and many of them are used in just a few methods, so the class could be broken in smaller, more cohesive classes.  
-Room (in the file model.py) has many attributes that are not used in its methods.


9. 
The author uses comments really rarely and some of them don’t really explain much.
Examples of good comments:

- # Check whether we should offer a hint.(line 389 of game.py)

- # Handle suspend separately, since filename can be anything,
  # and is not restricted to being a vocabulary word (and, in
  # fact, it can be an open file). 	
  (line 507 of game.py)  			

Examples of bad comments:
- #6010 (line 209 of game.py and in many other places there are other number) those are line place holder: they are considered bad comments. Even though in this case the author explain at the beginning of game.py that they are placed so to have a reference to the Fortran equivalent program .

- foobar = -1  # FOOBAR turn number of most recent still-valid "fee" (line 27 of game.py): Comment shouldn’t explain the name of a variable that could explain itself with a better name.

- # stack()[0] is this; stack()[1] is adventure.play(); so, stack()[2] (line 29 of prompt.py)


10. 
In the function:
do_motion(self, word) (line 269 of file game.py)
vertical formatting has been used to make the code clear. 


11. In the directory tests there are three test files: 
test_commands.py
test_data.py
test_walks.py
They all should me moved to the parent directory because they depends on the files there. 
And also, we need to add the one of code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

1) for test_commands.py: 
After that the result of the test are:
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 4.027s

OK


2) for test_data.py:
..........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 10 tests in 0.108s

OK

3)for test_walks.py (to run this test we also need to move to the parent directory the two file: syntax.txt and vignettes.txt):
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 2.886s

OK

Once moved and changed as described, the tests all respect the F.I.R.S.T. criteria.
